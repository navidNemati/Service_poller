# Service_poller
GUI made by Python. This GUI provides status of the URLs with "Ok" or "Fail"

# Instruction 
There are 3 frames (Data Frame, Buttons, and Get Status) and 5 buttons (Choose File, Load File, Get Status, Add URL, Delete URL, Update)

-- Choose File:  User can choose a .csv file and see the path of the file. 
-- Load File: User can see the .csv file  in the "Data Frame" frame.
-- Get Status: User can see the status of the URLs in the "Get Status" frame
-- Add URL: User can add a new URL. 
-- Delete URL: User can delete a URL
-- Update: User can update the .csv file with the new status.

Note that, after adding, deleting or updating, user needs to press "Load File" to see the new data frame. 

Caveat: .csv should have these 4 columns:  "Address", "Last_update", "Status", and "Time_added".
